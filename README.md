# AllWaters

The workflow is as such:

1. from /pdbfiles, run fme_to_met and other necessary helpers to build a valid pdb file
2. Run convert.py on an Atomic Radii file to convert to a C++ Map
3. Using .pdb and .vert files, build and run ./main using build.sh to create internal gridpoints
4. Run compare_waters with external Cavitomix Files to create overlap/common files and unique gridpoint files
5. (Optional) Using categorize_water (Panyue's algorithm), remove waters until no unique cavitomix waters are left.
6. Run reformat.py on .pdb generated by categorize_water
7. Build and Run ./find_clusters using build_clusters.sh
